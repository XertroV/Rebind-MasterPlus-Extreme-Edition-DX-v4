# Never Give Up (Openplanet Plugin for TM2020)

This plugin will give you an easy button to unbind 'Give Up' in COTD (and ranked), along with a high-visibility reminder prompt that will automatically disappear when 'Give Up' is unbound.
When you return to a menu or different game mode, you'll be prompted to rebind 'Give Up' (with a button to do so).

You can easily hide the prompt with one-click if you want it to go away for that session. (It will show up again the next time you're in an appropriate game mode.)

You can optionally set additional game modes.

<!-- Ideally in the future the plugin could re-bind 'Give Up' to respawn automatically and temporarily, so no user action is required. That is not trivial to do currently, though. -->
