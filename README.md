# Never Give Up (Openplanet Plugin for TM2020)

This plugin will show you a high-visibility reminder prompt to unbind 'Give Up' in COTD (and ranked) and will automatically disappear when 'Give Up' is unbound.

You can easily hide the prompt with one-click if you want it to go away for that session. (It will show up again the next time you're in an appropriate game mode.)

You can optionally set additional game modes.

Currently, it does not remind you to re-bind 'Give Up', but you notice pretty quickly next time you try to use it.

Ideally in the future the plugin could re-bind 'Give Up' to respawn automatically and temporarily, so no user action is required. That is not trivial to do currently, though.
